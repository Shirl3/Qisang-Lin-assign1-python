Overview
This repository contains a series of exercises designed to enhance your understanding of Python programming. Each exercise focuses on different concepts, from basic syntax to advanced data structures. 

Key Concepts Covered

1. Python Language Basics
- High-Level Language: Python is known for its readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners.
- Interpreted Language: Code is executed line by line, which allows for immediate feedback and easier debugging.

2. Syntax and Structure
- Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, enhancing readability.
  Variables: Variables store data values, and comments can be added using `#` to explain code.

 3. Data Structures
- Lists: Ordered and mutable collections that can hold items of different types.
  - Example: `universities = ['ESADE', 'UAB', 'UIB']`
  
- Dictionaries: Key-value pairs that allow for fast lookups.
  - Example: `universities = {'ESADE': 1958, 'UAB': 1968}`
  
- Tuples: Immutable sequences that can hold multiple items.
  - Example: `universities = ('ESADE', 'UAB')`
  
- Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.
  - Example: `universities = {'ESADE', 'UAB'}`

4. Control Flow
- Conditional Statements: Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.
- Loops: Utilize `for` and `while` loops to iterate over data structures.

5. Functions
- Functions allow you to encapsulate code for reuse, improving modularity in your programs.
  - Example:
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
