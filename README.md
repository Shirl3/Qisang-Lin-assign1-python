This is the assignmnet for exercise for session 3 is QISANG LIN ASSIGNMENT 3 PYTHON and it's in the branch of assigment3.
**#Overview**
This project implements a Course Registration System using Python object-oriented programming concepts. The system manages students, courses, and grades, and provides functionalities to enroll students in courses, assign grades, and calculate a student's GPA (Grade Point Average).

The system consists of three main classes:
Student: Represents a student with a unique ID and the ability to enroll in courses and manage grades.
Course: Represents a course with a name and description.
Registration: A central class that manages students and courses, and provides the logic for enrollment, dropping courses, and GPA calculation.
