Python Programming assignment1 which is QISANG LIN PYTHON ASSIGNMENT1.ipynb

Overview This repository contains a series of exercises designed to enhance your understanding of Python programming. Each exercise focuses on different concepts, from basic syntax to advanced data structures.

Key Concepts Covered

Python Language Basics
High-Level Language: Python is known for its readability and simplicity, making it ideal for beginners.
Interpreted Language: Code is executed line by line, which allows for immediate feedback and easier debugging.
Syntax and Structure
Indentation: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, enhancing readability. Variables: Variables store data values, and comments can be added using # to explain code.
Data Structures
Lists: Ordered and mutable collections that can hold items of different types.

Example: universities = ['ESADE', 'UAB', 'UIB']
Dictionaries: Key-value pairs that allow for fast lookups.

Example: universities = {'ESADE': 1958, 'UAB': 1968}
Tuples: Immutable sequences that can hold multiple items.

Example: universities = ('ESADE', 'UAB')
Sets: Unordered collections of unique elements.

Example: universities = {'ESADE', 'UAB'}
Control Flow
Conditional Statements: Use if, elif, and else to execute code based on conditions.
Loops: Utilize for and while loops to iterate over data structures.
Functions
Functions allow you to encapsulate code for reuse, improving modularity in your programs.
Example: def add(a, b): return a + b
